This is a test release!

The latest test release (if any) is available at
  ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/hello/

Ordinarily, reports about pretest releases like this one are sent to a
different list than for official releases.  In the case of GNU Hello,
though, traffic is so low this is not necessary.  Therefore, please
email bug reports, comments, etc. to bug-hello@gnu.org.

You are welcome to join this list;
to do so, visit http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-hello.
It's archived at http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/bug-hello.

If you see a problem in this release that you've already reported, feel
free to re-report it -- it's good to get a reminder.  If you sent a
patch for a previous release, and you haven't received any feedback
about it, please do re-send it, it likely got lost.

For development environment information, see README.dev.
