  notice and this notice are preserved.

The development sources are available through anonymous CVS at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=hello


Autotools
---------
This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from CVS (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.


Building
--------
After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  sh ./autogen.sh
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.

When modifying the sources, or making a distribution, more is needed, as
follows:


Gnulib
------
This distribution also uses Gnulib (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib)
to share common files, with the files being checked in to CVS.  
To update from the current gnulib, get a gnulib checkout, and
then run
  /path/to/gnulib/gnulib-tool --add-import
in our top-level directory.

For the record, a first time invocation would be
  gnulib-tool --add-import --m4-base=gnulib/m4 --source-base=gnulib/lib \
              --no-vc-files getopt-gnu

Many more modules have been added since.  The currently-used gnulib
modules and other gnulib information are recorded in
gnulib/m4/gnulib-cache.m4.


srclist-update
--------------
This distribution also uses the srclist-update script from Gnulib to
update common standalone files, such as config.guess and texinfo.tex.

It is possible to use gnulib-tool to update all of them, but since not
every package wants or needs the overhead of gnulib-tool, Hello also
shows usage of srclist-update as a lightweight alternative.  Typically
it is run just before making a distribution, to ensure the common files
are up to date.

See build-aux/srclist.txt for more details.


Gettext
-------
When updating gettext, besides the normal installation on the system, it
is necessary to run gettextize -f in this hierarchy to update the po/
infrastructure.  After doing so, rerun gnulib-tool --import since
otherwise older files will have been imported.  See the Gnulib manual
for more information.
