# This file is input for the script config/srclist-update in the gnulib
# project (http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib).  Typical invocation:
# 
# /path/to/gnulib/config/srclist-update \
#   /path/to/srcdir </path/to/srcdir/build-aux/srclist.txt
# 
# The output will be diffs for any files that are not up to date.
# 
# You can checkout gnulib via CVS or git; its build-aux, doc, and
# config subdirectories are the only ones needed for this.  It is
# entirely independent of gnulib-tool.  (See Hello's README-dev.)
# 
# The files listed here are those which are commonly needed (and
# commonly out of date) in source packages.
