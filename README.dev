This README.dev file describes the development environment.

The development sources are available through anonymous CVS at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=hello

This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from CVS (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

This distribution also uses Gnulib (http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib)
to share common files.  The files are checked in to CVS.  If you want to
update from the current gnulib, do a cvs checkout of gnulib, and then
run
  gnulib-tool --import
in the top-level directory of hello.  First time invocation was
  gnulib-tool --import --m4-base=gnulib/m4 --source-base=gnulib/lib
Those settings are now kept in gnulib/m4/gnulib-cache.m4.

After getting the CVS sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  ./bootstrap
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.
